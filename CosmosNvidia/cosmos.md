# Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform for Physical AI

## 1. Overview and Goals

### Core Concept
The Cosmos World Foundation Model (WFM) platform, developed by NVIDIA, is a general-purpose framework for creating **digital twins** of the world. These digital twins enable the training of **Physical AI (PAI)** systems.

### Physical AI Training Paradigm
PAI systems are trained digitally using:
1. A digital twin of themselves.
2. A digital twin of the world (WFM).  
This approach ensures safer, faster, and more flexible training.

### Open-Source Approach
NVIDIA is making this platform open-source with permissive licenses via NVIDIA Cosmos, providing models with open weights to help developers address critical challenges in PAI.

## 2. Key Components of the Cosmos Platform

### Video Curation Pipeline
- Prepares training data through **shot detection**, which segments videos into clips based on scene changes.
- **Shot Detection**: Segments raw videos into clips, discarding:
  - Clips shorter than 2 seconds.
  - Splits clips longer than 60 seconds into smaller segments.
- **ShotBench**: Demonstrates superior performance (recall/precision/F1) compared to existing algorithms.

### Cosmos Tokenizer
A suite of **visual tokenizers** for images and videos, designed for WFM training.  
- **Function**: Compresses videos into compact tokens while preserving visual content, similar to a video codec.
- **Architecture**:
  - Attention-based encoder-decoder with a temporally causal design.
  - Processes frames sequentially using wavelet transforms and convolution.
  - Trained jointly on images and videos, operating across multiple aspect ratios.
- **Performance**: Outperforms existing tokenizers with:
  - **+4 dB PSNR improvement** in reconstruction quality.
  - **12x faster speed**.

### Pre-trained WFMs
Two WFM types are developed:  
1. **Diffusion-based**: Uses denoising score matching loss, scaling efficiently with modern GPUs.  
   - Tackles the generation problem via sequential denoising.  
2. **Autoregressive-based**: Predicts the next video token in a sequence using a transformer decoder.  
   - Supports text prompts through cross-attention.

### Scalability
The platform leverages **NVIDIA H100 GPUs**, enabling large-scale training for complex tasks.

## 3. Key Technical Details

### World Model Definition
A WFM predicts future observations based on past data and current world perturbations:  
`A WFM predicts the future observation at time t+1 based on past observations (x0:) and current perturbations (ct).`

### Tokenization
Video tokenization compresses rich visual data into compact tokens:
- **Challenge**: Balancing compression rate with reconstruction quality.  
- **Trade-off**: High compression reduces storage but risks losing essential details.

### Causal Design
The architecture emphasizes **temporal causality**, ensuring information is processed chronologically:
- Uses **causal temporal convolution** and **causal temporal attention layers**.

### Architecture Highlights
- **Token Types**: Supports discrete (Finite-Scalar-Quantization) and continuous tokens.  
- **Diffusion Model Architecture**:
  - Adapted from DiT for video.
  - Features 3D patchification, query-key normalization, and AdaLN-LoRA for efficiency.
- **Autoregressive Model Architecture**:
  - Transformer decoder with FSQ vocabulary and text conditioning.

### Training Strategies
- **Joint Training**: Alternates between images and videos for cross-modal knowledge transfer.
- **Progressive Training**: Increases resolution and context length in stages.
- **Memory Optimization**: Uses techniques like Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) and Context Parallelism (CP).
- **Medusa Heads**: Accelerates inference by strategically inserting heads after the last transformer hidden state.

## 6. Limitations and Future Work

### Evaluation
A comprehensive evaluation framework for WFMs is yet to be developed.

### Safety
Keyword blocking mitigates unsafe content generation but requires continuous refinement.

### Scalability
Opportunities to enhance scalability include:
- Adopting memory-saving techniques like MQA or GQA.
