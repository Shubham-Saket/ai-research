# LlamaV-o1 - Rethinking Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning in LLMs  

## 1. Introduction & Core Problem  

- **Focus on Reasoning:**  
  The paper emphasizes the importance of step-by-step reasoning for solving complex visual problems. Existing methods for evaluating visual reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are deemed insufficient.  

- **Limitations of Current Benchmarks:**  
  Current benchmarks prioritize end-task accuracy and fail to assess the quality and logical coherence of reasoning processes.  
  > *"A notable gap in current visual reasoning benchmarks is their lack of emphasis on step-by-step reasoning. Most benchmarks focus primarily on end-task accuracy, neglecting the quality of intermediate reasoning steps."*  

- **Need for Structured Evaluation:**  
  The lack of standardized evaluation hinders accurate model comparison and slows progress in developing true visual reasoning capabilities.

## 3. Reasoning Process & Training Methodology  

- **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  
  Example from VRC-Bench (Math & Logic):  
  1. Step 1: Identify ∠AOC and ∠COB as a linear pair.  
     - Action: ∠AOC + ∠COB = 180°  
  2. Step 2: Calculate ∠AOC using ∠BOC = 67°.  
     - Action: ∠AOC = 180° - 67° = 113°  
  3. Step 3: Use ∠COD = 90° to find ∠AOD.  
  4. Step 4: Compute ∠AOD = 113° - 90° = 23°.  

- **Curriculum Learning:**  
  - **Stage 1:** Image summarization and captioning (PixMo, Geo170K datasets).  
  - **Stage 2:** Detailed reasoning tasks (Llava-CoT dataset).  

- **Base Model:** Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct for strong multimodal reasoning.
